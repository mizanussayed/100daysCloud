# Day 43: Configuring Azure VM with Application Gateway

## 🎯 Objective
The Nautilus Development Team needs to set up a new Azure Virtual Machine (VM) and configure it to run a web server. This VM should be part of an Azure Application Gateway (AGW) setup to ensure high availability and better traffic management. The task involves creating a VM, setting up an AGW, configuring a backend pool, and ensuring the web server is accessible via the AGW public IP.

**Create a Network Security Group (NSG):**
 Create an NSG named nautilus-nsg and add an inbound security rule Allow-HTTP to allow TCP traffic on port 80.

**Create a Virtual Machine:** Create a VM named nautilus-vm using any available Ubuntu image. Configure the instance with the following settings:

- Size: Choose a lightweight VM size (e.g., Standard_B1s).

- Authentication: Use SSH public key authentication. (Please select use existing public key option, create public-key locally and paste contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

- OS Disk: Use a Standard HDD.

- Networking: Under the Advanced section, attach an existing NSG (e.g., nautilus-nsg).

Additionally, configure the instance to run a user data script during launch that:

- Install the Nginx package.

- Start the Nginx service.

**Set up an Application Gateway:**  Set up an Azure Application Gateway named nautilus-agw with the following:

- Create and Associate it with a public IP address named nautilus-agw-ip.

- Attach the backend pool:nautilus-backendpool to the VM nautilus-vm.

- Select a subnet for the Application Gateway (you can create a new one if needed).

**Configure HTTP Settings:** Create an HTTP setting named nautilus-http-settings on port 80

- Route Traffic: Add a listener named nautilus-listener and a routing rule named nautilus-routing-rule to route traffic from the AGW frontend to the backend pool:

- Listener: Frontend IP = public IP, Frontend port = 80, Protocol = HTTP

- Routing rule: Connects nautilus-listener to nautilus-backendpool using nautilus-http-settings.

**NSG Adjustments:** Make sure the NSG attached to the VM allows inbound TCP traffic on port 80, so the Nginx server running on nautilus-vm is accessible via the Application Gateway public IP.

Note: Wait for the Application Gateway resource to be fully deployed before proceeding with the next steps. Deployment may take several minutes to complete.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
